# smartparkingsystem
This project is a low-level backend design and implementation of a Smart Parking Lot Management System developed using pure Java (no frameworks). It simulates how an automated parking lot manages vehicle entry, parking spot allocation, fee calculation, and exit handling — all while maintaining thread-safety and real-time spot updates.
